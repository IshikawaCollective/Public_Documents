Systemic consensus is currently the decision-making procedure for all group decisions and discussions to find democratic-like solutions without blocking the process itself.

## Procedure:
0.	Select a (empathic) moderator and/or a confidential person

1.	Write down a question

	Valid questions may not be answered yes or no.

2.	Collecting proposals for solutions

	Proposed solutions are not yet evaluated, commented or discussed.

3.	Determine resistances

	- Each proposed solution is scored by each participant with "resistance points" (0 = fully agreed with the proposal, 10 = fully rejected against the proposal).
	- All resistance points are noted in a matrix (columns/y-Axis = proposals, rows/x-Axis = participants).
	- A copy of the matrix shall be attached in the protocol archive.

4.	Numeric evaluation

	- All participants give their ratings to the moderator or selected confidential person. Can be performed anonymously.
	- The resistance points are added for each proposal.
	- The proposal with the lowest amount experiences the least resistance in the group and is the best solution.

5.	Evaluation of content

	- All participants are given equal consideration. There are allowed to express their thoughts without interruptions.
	- Discuss resistance values.
	- Why are participants resisting?
	- What thoughts and emotions are behind the values?
	- Are there participants who experience high resistance against the best solution? Can they suggest improvements in exchange for lowering their resistance?
	- Are there any outliers? Reasons for that? Are they OK with the best solution?
	- Are there second or third best solutions? Is it possible to combine their advantages?
